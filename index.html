		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="text-block">
			<p>I've worked at Aptoide and at Codacy. Both were very positive experiences.</p>
			<p>I started programming at 18 and created DevChannel, which was, for a couple of years, a very fun community of people learning more about programming (now mostly dead).</p>
			<p>I took Computer Science at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.</p>
			<p>I'm generally bad at remembering the names of things, I only focus on understanding them. But I'm slowly learning that knowing the names is important when talking to other people.
			<p>I have experience with the following technologies (in order of most to least experience)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python (including frameworks like Flask and Django)</li>
				<li>Golang</li>
				<li>Git</li>
				<li>SQL, MongoDB</li>
				<li>Javascript, HTML, CSS</li>
				<li>Linux</li>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Docker</li>
				<li>C, C++</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Possibly more, I am generally willing to learn about anything that piques my interest.</li>
			</ul>
